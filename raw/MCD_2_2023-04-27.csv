Note our assumption that the Mrt, Stw, and Wol independent forms are secondary formations from the bound form with possessive suffix, which would be the one in most common use. Cf. also PMc *kapa ‘bundle of something’ It is possible to see a semantic connection between rolled up mats, bundles, bundles of grass put between babies’ legs for waste management, the rolling up of woven cloth on the loom-beam, and the cloth itself, especially that of a kind used for babies’ waste disposal.
