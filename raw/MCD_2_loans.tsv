L1	Chk áchiiyu ‘a tree (Ixora carolensis)’; Mrt ashiiyow; Stw yaRiiyow; Wol gashiou ‘a kind of tree (Ixora casei)’; Pon kɛtiew ‘sp. of tree (Ixora casei)’; Png kalesu; Mrs kajdéw ‘a tree (Ixora carolinensis)’; Ksr kalsrʌ ‘a kind of plant’ (Bender et al. 1984 ‘a shrub with red flowers’)	These appear to be loans, possibly from Pal kerdeu ‘Ixora plant’.
L2	Chk amóneset ‘a tree (Messerschmidia argentea)’ (also Chk néét); Pul yamolehát ‘tree heliotrope (Messerschmidia argentea)’; Crl amaleeset and Crn amaneeset ‘sp. of tall tree found on sandy beaches’.	This appears to be a loan within the Chuukic languages. Cf. Pal rirs ‘tree heliotrope’. See also PMc *ceni, ceceni ‘strand tree’.
L3	Chk anné ‘a tree (Cordia subcordata)’; Pul yaané, yaalúw, yaalúwá-(n) ‘a tree (Cordia subcordata), t. of’; Crl alúw and Crn anné ‘a tree (Cordia subcordata)’; Wol galúwe ‘a tree (Cordia subcordata)’.	These forms seem to be loans. See also PCMc *kana, kai ‘habit, tendency’.
L4	Chk ápuuch ‘a tree (Crataeva sp.)’; Mrt afuush; Pul yáfuuR; Crl afuush; Crn afuuR; Stw afuuR; Wol yafuushu, yefuushu.	These appear to be loans from Yap qabiich, qabyuch ‘a type of tree with edible fruit’.
L5	Chk aroma, óroma ‘Abutilon shrub’; Mrt aroma ‘Pipturus argentus’; Pul yóroma ‘a tree’; Stw yaroma ‘Pipturus argentus’; Wol yaromaa ‘Pipturus tree’; PCk *yaromaa; Mok ɔrmo ‘tree sp.’; Png oroma ‘Pipturus argentus’; Mrs harmwey ‘Pipturus argenteus tree’.	Possibly a loan from Chamorro aroma ‘a spiny shrub’.
L6	Chk attu, áttu, kattu, káttu ‘cat, housecat’; Pul kattu; Crl ghattu; Crn gattu; Stw kattu; Wol ghaatuu.	These are loans from Chm katuu, which is in turn a loan from Spanish. Kir (te)-katama is a loan from another, but not clear, source.
L7	Chk á-áni-pé ‘fan’ (lit. ‘make wind blowing’), á-áni-péé-(w) ‘f. him, beckon to her’; Pul yá-áni-pé ‘to fan’; Crl áli-pé, alú-pé, alé-pé ‘a f.’, áli-pee-(w) (sic) ‘to f. s.o.’; Crn há-ánúpé ‘a hand f.’; Wol ga-ali-péé ‘f., to wave’, ga-ali-péé-(we) ‘f. him’.	Cf. PuA úlú-paú ‘f.’ Crn h instead of expected g and Pul and Crn n and Crl and Wol l instead of expected ŋ suggest the Pul, Crl, Crn, and Wol forms are loans originally from Chk.
L8	Chk ásááp, ásáppi-(n) ‘shuttle (of loom), s. of’; Wol gesaape; PuA kadape (sic).	This appears to be a loanword, since we have PuA d instead of expected t.
L9	Chk eep, #eppi-(n) ‘yam, y. of’; Pul yeep, yepi-n; Wol seepe, sepa-(li).	Presumably a loan from Yap theap. Cf. PMP *qubi (Blust 1984–85). See also PPC ? *kaapi ‘yam’.
L10	Chk eyi-reŋes ‘a tree (Pittosporum sp.)’; Pul yayi-reŋes, -reŋese-(n) ‘Pittosporum tree, t. of’.	The Pul form appears to be a loan from Chk. Cf. PCk *yalle-pwuta ‘a tree (Pittosporum)’.
L11	Chk éwú-ni-yár ‘whirlwind, waterspout, name of a storm god’; Mrt awú-ni-yar ‘whirlwind, tornado, rainbow’; Pul nááwú-ni-yer, -ere-(n) (sic) ‘waterspout, whirlwind, w. of’; Crl layú-li-yár ‘tornado, whirlwind, waterspout’; Stw nááwú-ni-yár ‘tornado’; Wol laú-li-are ‘rainbow’; Pon ey-ni-ar ‘whirlwind, gust of wind containing rain’; Yap naenyoer ‘tornado, waterspout’.	This looks like a chain of loans, from Pon through Chk without an initial *n and from Pul through Yap with one, showing a reinterpretation along the chain between Chk and Pul. Marck (1994:316) reconstructs PPC *auniari ‘whirlwind’, but it is questionable.
L12	Chk feeyis ‘name of Fais Island, Western Carolines’; Pul faayis; Wol faisse.	The Chk and Pul forms appear to be loans.
L13	Chk féyiyew, féyiyewe-yi-rek ‘name of Gaferut Island (West Fayu) in the Central Carolines’; Pul fayeewowa-y-rek (sic) ‘name of Gaferut Island (West Fayu)’; Crl fayiééw ‘name of Gaferut Island (West Fayu)’; Wol féúyeewe ‘name of a place in Woleai’.	Looks like a chain of interdialect loans.
L14	Chk iyap ‘name of Yap Islands’; Pul yaap; Crl yaap; Wol yaape; Uli eap; Pon yap; Mrs yiyahabw; Ksr yɛp.	These are clearly a progression of loans, with the Ksr form coming from the English form of the name. Cf. Yap waqab.
L15	Chk kanuf, kanufe-(n) ‘large, multicolored lizard (introduced to Chuuk by the Japanese to kill rats), l. of’; Mrt kaluf ‘l.’; Pul kóluuf kóluufá-(n) ‘giant l. (introduced by Japanese)’; Crl ghaluuf, ghóluuf ‘a black and green forest l., gecko’; Stw kaluf ‘l.’; Wol galúfe ‘kind of l.’; PuA kanúda ‘l.’; Yap galuuf ‘monitor l.’; Pal chelub ‘Indian monitor l.’	We have here an evident chain of loans from Pal to Yap to the Chuukic languages.
L16	Chk ki-imweyimw ‘house on lee platform of sailing canoe’; Pul yá-yimwayimw ‘pandanus thatch house that fits on lee side of sailing canoe’; Stw ki-imweimw ‘hut on deep water sailing canoe’; Wol ga-imweimwe ‘sheltered area on a canoe’.	These look like internal Chuukic loans. See PMc *umwa, imwa ‘house’.
L17	Chk (ki)-pwpwaaw, -pwpwaawe-(n) ‘papaya tree and fruit, p. of’; Mrt pwawúpwaaw; Pul pwáyipwáy; Crl bweibwaay; Stw pwaipwaay; Wol beibaaye.	This is an introduced plant in postcolonial times and these forms represent a set of loans. Cf. Yap baabaay; Pal bobai.
L18	Chk kómwu, kkómwu, kómwuti, komwuuti, kómwuu-(n) ‘sweet potato, s. p. of’; Mrt kamwééti; Pul yómwuutiy, kómwuutiy, yómwuutiyá-(n); Crl ghómwuuti, ghamwuuti, ghómwuutti, ghómwutti; Stw kómwuuti, komote; Wol gamwuutiye; Yap kamoet, kamuut.	These represent a chain of earlier and later loans from Chm kamuti and Spanish camote from Nahuatl.
L19	Chk konaak ‘dog’; Pul kolaak; Crl ghulóógh; Crn gulaag; Wol gelaagu.	This is a loan from Chamorro ga’lagu. Note that PuA pinisi is a loan from Pal bilis.
L20	Chk maas, maase-(n) ‘march, marching, a dance with a marching step and moves based on close-order military drill, m. of’; Pul maas, másá-(n) ‘a marching dance, d. of’; Crl maas ‘men's marching dance’; Wol maasi ‘a kind of dance’; Yap maas ‘marching dance’; Mrs mwahaj ‘to march, parade’.	These forms are clearly loans, the Chuukic and Yap ones possibly from German and the Mrs one (which does not involve a dance) from English.
L21	Chk maŋaak, maŋaakú-(n) ‘cloth, c. of ’; Pul méŋaak; Crl móŋoogh, Crn mwoŋaag; Wol meŋaagu, megaagu.	These are loans via Wol from Chm magagu ‘clothes, dress, shirt, yardage’.
L22	Chk márá ‘yard or cleared ground around a house or meeting house’; Kir marae ‘playground’.	The Kir form is clearly a loan from Sam malae ‘village green’, and in the absence of any attested cognate forms in other MC languages, we must assume, for the present, that the Chk form is a loan from Kir. See PPn malaqe ‘meeting place’.
L23	Chk moropw, moropwu-(n) ‘coverlet, cover, sheet, c. of’; Wol marubu ‘a ceremonial white woven skirt, a type of tribute consisting of woven skirts’.	Cf. Pal meleleb ‘cover with a blanket’; Yap mathrow ‘to cover, a cover’.
L24	Chk mwéék, mwékúmwék ‘arrowroot (Tacca leontopetaloides)’; Pul mwakomwak; Crl móghomógh; Crn mógomóg; Wol mwégúmwégú; Uli mógmóg; Sns mogomogo; Pon mwɛkimwɛk; Mok mwɔkmwɔk; Mrs mwakmwék; Ksr mokmok.	This looks like a chain of loans. The Ksr form with its initial m is clearly a loan. [The Mrs form exhibits the a/é alternation expected of fully reduplicated *C1aC2V+hi roots.]
L25	Chk mwiik, mwiike-(n), #mwikke-(n) ‘pepper plant, hot pepper, p. of’; Pul m w m w iik, (ya)-mwmwiik, (ya)-mwmwiiká-(n) ‘chili pepper, c. p. of’; Crl mwiigh, (a)-mweigh ‘chili pepper’; Crn (a)-mwiig ‘chili pepper’; Wol mwmwiige, mwmwiiga-(li) ‘hot pepper, p. of’.	Apparently a loan from Chamorro pika ‘burn with hot pepper’, donne’ pika ‘hot pepper’.
L26	Chk nichopw ‘second finest grade of pandanus mat’; Pon lirop ‘mat’.	Perhaps a loan here, from Pul to Pon.
L27	Chk niyoos, niyossu-(n) ‘image, statue, doll, picture, representation, i. of’; Mrt liyoss ‘i., d.’; Pul liyos, liyosá-(n) ‘s., i., d., weather charm’; Crl liyoos ‘religious i. or s.’; Crn liyoos ‘d., any s.’; Stw nios ‘d.’; Wol liyoose ‘s., toy, shape, i.’; PuA niyoso ‘d.’; Mok liɔs ‘demon’.	Said by Jackson (1991:101) to be a loan via Chm from Spanish [dios], which would account for the s in Pul and Crn instead of expected h.
L28	Chk nómwo-chchek ‘name of Lamotrek (island and atoll) in the Central Carolines’; Pul namo-ccek (we expect *nómwo-ccek); Crl lamwo-tchegh (we expect *lómwo-tchegh); Crn namwo-tcheg (we expect *nómwo-tcheg); Wol lamwo-ch-chegi (<*lamwo-li-ragi ‘lagoon of the west’).	If the derivation of the Wol form is correct, the other forms are clearly loans.
L29	? Chk nusu-paat ‘mud skipper fish’ (lit. ‘continual jump’); Pul luhu-ppat ‘a kind of small, dark, leaping f.’ (i.e., mud skipper); Crl lusu-fat ‘sp. of inedible rock f.’	Looks like internal Chk coinage and loan. See PMc *luTu ‘to jump’.
L30	Chk owuru-pik ‘name of Eauripik (island and atoll), Central Carolines’; Pul Yoru-pik (we expect *yoorupik); Wol yauru-pige.	The Chk and Pul forms look like loans from Wol. Cf. PCk *piike.
L31	Chk paanaw ‘name of the Palaw or Belaw Islands’; Pul paalawu (sic); Crl palley; Wol belaau; Uli bwalau.	These are a progession of loans. Cf. Pal belau.
L32	? Chk panaw ‘a tree poisonous to the skin (Semicarpus)’; Cf. Chm panao ‘hardwood tree good for lumber’; Pal belau ‘Guettarda tree’, toŋét ‘poisonous tree in mango family (S. venenosa)’.	Cf. Chk péné ‘a tree (Thespasia populnea)’.
L33	Chk pike-noot, #pike-nooch ‘name of former Pikelot Island in Central Carolines, destroyed by a typhoon’; Pul pikollot; Wol pige-n-noote (<*pige-li-loota).	These forms appear to result from borrowing within the Chuukic languages.
L34	Chk ppek ‘shoot (with a gun), gun, firearm’, pekki-i-(y) ‘s. (s.o.) with a gun’; Mrt pakki-i-; Pul pekk, pekki-i-(y); Crl pákk, pákki-i-(y); Stw pákki-i-(y); Wol pakki, pakki-i-(ye); Uli pak ‘gun’; Mrs pakkey ‘big gun, cannon’.	These are apparently loans from Chamorro paki ‘gun, s. a gun’.
L35	Chk pwanaŋ, pwanaŋe-(n) ‘ilangilang tree (Cananga odorata), t. of’; Pul pwalaŋ.	Cf. Crl láŋiiláŋ ‘C. odorata’; Pal chiraŋ ‘C. odorata; Chm alaŋilaŋ ‘C. odorata’; PMP kanaŋa ‘C. odorata’ (Blust 1984–85).
L36	Chk pwonnap ‘name of Pulap Island’; Mrt pwollap; Pul bwollap; Wol bénnap.	The Chk form of the name appears to be a loan from Pul.
L37	Chk pwpwu, pwpwuu ‘areca or betel nut’; Pul puw (sic); Crl pwpwu; Stw pwpwu; Wol bbuwe; PuA pua (sic); Pon pwuu; Mok pwu.	All are presumably loans directly or indirectly from Yap buw or Pal buuch. Cf. POc *buaq (Ross 1988) (Kwa bua; Saa pue and Ula pua; Lak bua); PMP *buaq ‘b. nut’(Blust 1984–85).
L38	Chk resiim, resiime-(n) ‘rainbow, r. of’ (god of rainbow was god of war); Crl rásiim, Crn rehiim; PuA lakimu (sic); Pon rakim (sic) ‘god of war’; Mrs rakyim ‘to plunder, destroy and take everything, ravage, ransack, loot’; Ksr (le)-lækwem, (ne)-lækwem ‘r.’	This appears to be a loanword in at least some of these languages; cf. Palau orrekim ‘r.’, Yap ragim ‘r.’ Marck’s (1994:311) reconstruction of PMc *rakiimi is open to some question.
L39	Chk saasaf ‘soursop tree’; Pul saasaf, saasap; Yap saawsaaw.	These seem to be loans from English.
L40	Chk seniwis ‘name for the Marshall Islands’; Wol saliwisi ‘name for the Marshall Islands’; Mrs jaléwéj ‘Jaluit (island and atoll)’.	The Chk and Wol forms are clearly loans from Mrs.
L41	Chk sééwúr, sééwúrú-n ‘plumeria, p. of’; Mrt sééwúr; Pul yééwúr; Crl seyúr, séyúr; Stw sééyúr; Wol sééúrú; Uli sour.	Cf. Yap sowur, from which this seems to be a loan.
L42	Chk ténaaw, ténaawe-(n) ‘mat, m. of’; Mrt télaw (sic) ‘mat’; Mrs teļahwew ‘sitting mat’; Ksr tʌlæ ‘a kind of mat’.	There are problems here of the kind we might expect with loans.
L43	Chk tonoya, tonoyaa-n ‘circular throwing net, n. of’; Crl télóóya ‘throwing net’; Crn telaiya ‘throwing net’; Wol talaaiyaa ‘throwing net’.	These are apparently loans from Chamorro talaya ‘circular or throwing net’.
L44	Chk ttipi-s, ttipi-si-n ‘error, mistake, fault, sin, his e.’; Pul tipi-s, tipi-si-(n) ‘sin, mistake, error, s. of’ (a loan from Chk); Stw tipi-s ‘sin (not merely mistake)’; Pon diip, dipɛ ‘sin, wrong-doing, his s.’, dipe-(kelekel), dipwe-(kelekel) ‘to stumble, stub one's toe’; Mok dipi-j ‘to trip on (s.t.)’; Png dep ‘stumble and fall’; Mrs tip-jek ‘stumble, slip, trip’, tipi-j ‘to trip on (s.t.)’; Ksr tɨpi-s ‘bad ugly’.	We seem to have a chain of loans from Mrs in the wake of Protestant missionary activity that began in the Marshall Islands and spread westward from there. Cf. Wol tapissi ‘to slip, fall off, come off’, (ge)-tapissi-(i) ‘let it slip’.
L45	Chk tuumwu ‘to dye, do dying (any color)’; Crl tuumwu ‘locally made dye of any color used to color cloth’; Wol tumwu ‘to dye, color cloth or hair, color with a dye’.	Loan from Chm tumu ‘coloring, dye’.
L46	Chk túúr, túrú-(n) ‘loom for weaving, l. of’, túrú-ni ‘weave it’, túr ‘to weave on a l.’; Pul téér, térú-(n); Crl téér ‘l.’, ttér ‘weave on a l.’; Wol téérú, térú-(li) ‘l., l. of’, térú-ŋú-(ú) ‘weave it’; PuA taalú, talú-.	This is presumably a loan from a Philippine source. Cf. UAn *tenun ‘to weave’.
L47	Chk weeku, weekuu-(n) ‘ironwood tree (Casuarina equisetifolia), t. of’; Crl weighu, weeghu; Crn weegu.	Possible loans from Yap walguw ‘a type of tree’. Cf. Pal dort ‘ironwood tree’.
L48	Chk weneya ‘old name of Woleai (island and atoll)’, woneyaye (from English form of name); Mrt woleyaye (from English form?); Pul weniyay (from English form?); Crl woleyaay (from English form?); Crn weniya; Wol weleyaa.	These appear to be internal Chuukic loans.
L49	Chk wochááp ‘dragonfly’; Pul woRááp, woRáápi-(n); Crl oshááp, osháápi-(l); Wol goshaape; PuA kosappi.	The Crl, Wol, and PuA forms appear to be corruptions of the Chk and Pul forms, which can be analyzed as deriving from *koca-kapi meaning ‘butt-endeating’, reference being to the way dragonflies appear when flying in mating pairs. A reconstruction of PCk *kocakapi is questionable. See PMc *koca, oca ‘eat raw food’, PMc *kapi ‘bottom, butt end’.
L50	Chk wores ‘wash the face’; Pul wóráh ‘to w. (as the f. in the morning)’, wóráhi-i-(y) ‘w. it’; Crl urás, uráse-(ló) ‘w. one's f.’, (o)-urási-i-(y) ‘w. (s.o., as a child in the morning)’.	Is this a loan from Pidgin English?
L51	Crl atoobwey ‘name of Tobi Island, Western Carolines’; Crn gatogobwey; Wol gatogobei; PuA katokodei; Sns katokofei; Tbi gatogobwey.	These forms appear to be a chain of loans.
L52	Crl bwáila, bweila ‘sheath (for a knife)’; Wol bailaa.	Loan from Cham baina ‘sheath, scabbard’.
L53	Crl gaaghu ‘to be lazy’; Wol gaaguu.	Loan from Chm gago’ ‘lazy’.
L54	Crl laash ‘ironwood tree’; Wol laashi, lashi- ‘pine tree’; Uli laach ‘pine-like t.’ (Cf. Yap laach, naech, said to be borrowed from Uli); Chm ladda, lahda ‘Morinda citrifolia’; Pal ŋas ‘a type of pine t.’	A possible loan from Chm.
L55	Crl maaghuf, móóghuf ‘be happy, pleased’; Crn maagof ‘be h., p.’; Wol maagufe ‘be active, encouraged, animated’.	This is a loan from Chm magof ‘h., gay, glad, delight’.
L56	? Crl óghótooláŋ and Crn ógátooleŋ ‘large, hardwood tree (Eugenia palumbis)’; Wol gatoolaŋi ‘a kind of tree’.	Cf. Pal kesiil ‘Eugenia tree’.
L57	Crl pwpwuughas ‘uncooked rice, rice grain’; Wol peraasi ‘rice’; Uli pérás ‘rice’.	The Wol and Uli forms are apparent loans from Pal beras ‘rice’; and the Crl form is a loan from Chm pugas ‘uncooked rice’. See PAn *beRas (Blust 1984–85).
L58	Crl soŋoshól ‘name of Sonsorol Island, Western Carolines’; Crn saŋoRól; Wol soŋoshalo; PuA doŋosanú.	Cf. Yap soŋchol. The Crn form is clearly a loan.
L59	Kir maao ‘nearly finished (as a shower), be raining gently’, (ka)-maao-(a) ‘to wait upon (the rain) until the shower is quite over’; PPn *mao ‘cease raining’.	Note that the Kir forms may be loans from a Pn source, e.g., Sam maona ‘let up, abate, calm down (of rain, storm)’.
L60	Kir mim ‘to urinate’;	An apparent loan from a Pn source; cf. Sam miimii; Ton mimi.
L61	Kir ŋae ‘satiated’; Ksr ŋʌi ‘feel satisfied (especially after a good meal)’.	The Ksr form, where we would expect *ŋwe, is an apparent loan from Kir
L62	Ksr es ‘papaya’; Rot esu ‘papaya’; Sam esi ‘papaya’.	Cf. Ton lesi ‘papaya’. Other than in Ksr, cognates of this form are not attested in Micronesian languages. These are clearly products of borrowing.
L63	Mok jikalue ‘coconut toddy’; Mrs jekarew ‘coconut sap, toddy’; Kir te-karewe ‘fresh coconut sap’ (lit. ‘the sweet’); Ksr sʌkarʌ ‘coconut sap’.	The Mok and Mrs forms are loans from Kir (incorporating the Kir prefixed article), and the Ksr form is in turn a loan from Mrs (as indicated by the initial Ksr s from Mrs j).
L64	? Mok jor, jɔrɔ, jɔrɔ-(n) ‘handle, its h., h. of’; Mrs jirwe- ‘handle’.	The Mok form could be a loan from Mrs.
L65	Mok jɔpwrɔ ‘constellation Pleiades’; Mrs jebwraw ‘star eta Taurus (Pleiades)’; Ksr safuro ‘Pleiades’ (Lutke, Bender et al. 1984).	The Mok and Ksr forms are likely loans from Mrs.
L66	Mok jɔrom ‘lightning’; Mrs jarwem; Ksr særom.	The Mok and Ksr forms are likely loans from Mrs.
L67	Mok kidaak ‘Allophylus tree’; Png kidaak; Mrs kitahak.	Cf. Ksr kɨrak ‘kind of tree’. We seem to be dealing with loans here, probably from Mrs.
L68	Mok maŋiŋ ‘gone sour (as of spoiled liquid)’; Mrs maŋiŋ ‘old and s. fermented coconut sap’, ji-magig ‘fermented coconut toddy, s. toddy’; Kir maŋiŋ ‘drunk, intoxicated’, (te)ka-maŋiŋ ‘fermented or intoxicating coconut sap’, ka-maŋiŋ ‘intoxicating’.	The Mok and Mrs forms are loans from the Kir form (the second Mrs form incorporating the Kir prefixed article). See PMc *maŋiŋi for cognates of Kir maŋiŋ.
L69	Mok pwɛypwɛy, pwɛypwɛi-(n) ‘tuna, t. of’; Png pwɛypwɛy ‘tuna’; Mrs bweybwey ‘tuna’.	These could be loans from Mrs into Mok and Png. Cf. Wol baúre ‘kind of fish that looks like a barracuda’; Kir (te)-baibai ‘a fish’, baibwo ‘a fish’.
L70	Mrs jebwey ‘oar, paddle, rudder, steering wheel’; Kir (te)-bwee ‘oar, steering oar, rudder’; Sam foe ‘oar, paddle’; PPn *fohe; PEO *voze.	The Mrs form is clearly a loan from Kir, incorporating the Kir noun-marking prefix within it; and the Kir form is a loan from Sam.
L71	Mrs jibwabwbwayiy ‘a taro variety (Colocasia)’; Kir (te)-bwabwai ‘Colocasia taro’.	The Mrs form may be a loan from Kir, incorporating the prefixed Kir noun marker and exhibiting the final vowel of the Kir form, but see Bender (1981) for an alternative explanation. Cf. Chm baba’ ‘type of swamp taro’.
L72	Mrs téptép ‘chest, trunk, footlocker’; Ksr tʌptʌp ‘suitcase, trunk, chest, coffin’.	The Ksr form could well be a loan from Mrs, but see Yap dapdep ‘storage trunk’. Cf. Kir rabi ‘be curved laterally, indented as a coast, bellying as a sail’, rabirabi ‘wide laterally as a coconut shell bottle’.
L73	Mrs yanyén ‘to bail (as a canoe)’; Kir anan (sic) (*annan < *aniani); Ksr enyen.	We interpret the Mrs and Ksr forms as loans from Kir and the Kir form as a back formation from Kir (te)-anima ‘bailer’. Cf. PEO * [cz]aRu-m ‘b. out’ (Geraghty 1990).
L74	Mrt malék ‘chicken’; Pul malúk; Stw manúk; Crl malúgh; Wol malúge; Uli málég; Pon malɛk.	These are loans from Chm mannok ‘chicken’.
L75	Mrt mwuso ‘worm’; Pul mwóho ‘w.’; Crl mwusó ‘intestinal w.’	Cf. PMc *mwaata, mwata-. Could well be a chain of loans.
L76	Png pɛdɛd ‘fall’; Ksr pʌtat ‘fall, drop’.	In the absence of reported cognates from other languages, we must consider one of these a possible loan from the other.
L77	Pon ini ‘to carry two bundles of things with a pole across the shoulder’, iniɛ ‘to c. (s.t.) with a pole’; Mok inani (sic) ‘yoke or pole for carrying’; Png ini, iniani ‘yoke or pole for carrying’; Mrs yinéynéy ‘c. on the shoulders, bear a burden’, yineye-k ‘c. (s.t.) on the shoulders’; Ksr enʌ ‘pole, yoke’.	There are problems here, and we may be dealing with a chain of loans. Chk eyi-ni-wow ‘pole for carrying’ does not belong in this set.
L78	Pon kidi ‘dog’; Mrs kidiw; Kir (te)-kiri.	The Pon form is evidently a loan from Kir; the Mrs and Kir forms can be understood as loans from a Polynesian source (cf. PPn *kulii; Fij koli). Cf. Kwa ku’i. Cf. also Saa ’usu.
L79	Pon kitik ‘rat, mouse’; Mok kije-sik ‘small animal, lizard, mouse’, kije-sik (winan) ‘rat’; Mrs kij-dik ‘mouse, rat’ (lit. ‘little louse’); Ksr kɨsrik ‘cat, mouse, rat’.	The Pon and Ksr forms look like loans from Mrs; the Mok form could be either cognate with or a loan from Mrs. Cf. Lak kusuke ‘rat’. Cf. Also PCk *keci ‘rat’.
L80	Pon mwut, mwuti-(n) ‘counter for heaps or piles’; Mrs mwiwij ‘pile up plant materials’.	The Pon form is a loan from Mrs or the Mrs form a loan from Pon.
L81	? Pon sooŋ ‘to measure, survey, a measurement’; Mok joŋjoŋ ‘to measure’, joŋ ‘to measure (s.t.)’; Mrs jeŋwjeŋw ‘to measure, compare size’, jeŋwa- ‘size (of s.t.)’.	The long vowel of Pon presents a problem. We may have loans into Mok and Pon from Mrs here.
L82	PuA lépakaú ‘capable, able’; Kir rabakau ‘skillfull, dextrous, adept’.	The PuA form appears to be a direct loan from the Kir. (Kir men were recruited as boat crew by the late nineteenth-century traders in the Carolines.)
L83	Pul hoŋooŋo ‘a reef fish’; Crl soŋooŋo ‘sp. of edible reef fish’.	Note that Wol soŋooŋe ‘a kind of fish’ would appear to be a loan from a Crl-like source, since we would expect it to be *soŋooŋoo if it were an inherited form.
L84	Pul saraal ‘name of Sorol Island, Western Carolines’; Wol soróóle.	The Pul form is clearly a loan.
L85	Pul yásiika, yásiikaa-(n) ‘salt, to salt, s. of’, yásiikáá-ni ‘to s. or season (s.t.)’; Crl asiigha and Crn asiig ‘s.’; Stw yassika ‘s.’; Wol gasiigaa ‘s.’	These are apparent loans from Chm asiga.
L86	Stw sólop ‘land, earth’; Wol salope, talope (Bender et al. 1984) ‘earth, soil’; Uli talop, talopw ‘earth’ (Bender et al. 1984); PuA (i)-danopa ‘earth, ground, world’.	The variants and the d of the PuA form suggest that this is a loan from Yap danoop ‘world, earth, native land’. Cf. PMc *tano ‘ground, low’.
L87	Stw yabwiy ‘a plant’; Wol gabiye ‘a plant (Clerodendrum inerme)’; Uli habwi; Sns habiya.	Cf. Chk apwech ‘a plant’ (Clerodendrum inerme)’.Appears to be a loan into the West Chuukic languages from Yap gabuuy ‘a plant’ (cf. Yap gabuuy ‘pepper leaf for betel chewing’; Pal kebuy ‘pepper leaf for betel chewing’). Cf. PAn *apuR. ‘betel chew’ (Blust 1984–85).
L88	Wol kkeele, kkele, kkili ‘a tree (Terminalia catappa)’; Mrs kkéŋ [yékkéŋ, kékéŋ] ‘a tree (Terminalia litorali)’.	Cf. Pon kɛɛma ‘Terminalia carolinensis’, dipwɔpwo ‘Terminalia catappa’. These look like loans, if anything. See also PCk *kaata, kaataata ‘a tree (Terminalia catappa)’.
